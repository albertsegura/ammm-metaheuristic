AMMM Group Project
==================

This is a group project for the Algorithmic Methods for Mathematical Models class of the Master in Innovation and Research in Informatics of UPC.
Its objective is to solve the same problem (scheduling of instructions with dependencies amongst multiple execution streams reducing the timespan) using integer linear programing and two different metaheuristics (grasp and brkga).

Directories
* generator: random input generator
* ilp: integer linear programming implementation
* grasp: greedy randomized adaptive search procedure implementation
* brkga: biased random-key genetic algorithm implementation
* script: input generation and execution script

Team members:
* Diego Davila
* Albert Segura
* Pedro Benedicte
